vogl - Vanilla OpenGL Glyph Library
===================================
A lightweight, simple, and self-contained class to draw text in OpenGL.

* Depends on the [FreeType](http://www.freetype.org/) library for loading glyphs.
* Example application requires [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/).
* Includes may need to be tweaked to hit the right files. Feel free to send me a pull request
  with any changes you had to make to get this to compile on other platforms (was compiled
  with Clang on OS X Mavericks).
